- `UniversalToon2DOutline.hlsl.meta`
- `2D-Renderer-Support.md.meta`

## Technical Implementation Details

### 2D Light Integration
The shader now properly integrates with Unity's URP 2D light system:
- Uses `GetMainLight()` to access primary 2D light
- Supports `GetAdditionalLight()` for multiple 2D lights
- Properly handles light distance attenuation
- Applies shadow attenuation from 2D shadow maps
- Remaps N·L to 0-1 range for toon shading steps

### Toon Shading Algorithm
Multi-step toon shading is achieved through:
1. Calculate light intensity from N·L (normal dot light direction)
2. Apply smooth step with feathering between shade levels
3. Lerp between shade colors based on steps
4. Apply light color influence if enabled
5. Add ambient/GI contribution
6. Add rim light and specular highlights
7. Add emissive contribution

### Outline Rendering
Outlines are rendered using:
- Separate outline pass with "SRPDefaultUnlit" LightMode
- Two methods: normal-based (world space expansion) or position-based (screen space)
- Distance-based scaling for consistent width across camera distances
- Optional blending with base texture color
- Optional texture for outline width variation

### Performance Optimizations
- Shader keywords to disable unused features
- GPU instancing support
- Efficient texture sampling
- Optimized for 2D sprite rendering pipeline
- Conditional compilation for features

## Feature Coverage

### Supported Features (from 3D version)
✅ Multi-step toon shading (base, 1st shade, 2nd shade)
✅ Customizable shading steps and feathering
✅ Light color influence on shading
✅ Normal mapping
✅ Rim light (standard and antipodean)
✅ High color/specular
✅ Emissive (simple and animated)
✅ Outlines (normal and position-based)
✅ Alpha clipping and blending
✅ GI/Ambient light
✅ Unlit intensity
✅ Multiple lights support
✅ Shadow receiving
✅ GPU instancing
✅ Stencil support

### Not Supported in 2D (by design)
❌ Tessellation (not applicable to 2D)
❌ MatCap (can be added but requires 2D-specific implementation)
❌ Angel Ring (can be added but requires 2D-specific implementation)
❌ Some advanced 3D lighting features

### Differences from 3D Version
1. **Lighting Model**: Uses 2D light data instead of 3D directional lights
2. **Normal Handling**: Simplified for 2D sprite rendering
3. **Outline Rendering**: Optimized for screen-space consistency
4. **Shadow Receiving**: Uses 2D shadow maps
5. **Performance**: Optimized for 2D sprite batching

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the 2D renderer implementation:

1. **Basic Setup Test**:
   - Create URP project with 2D Renderer
   - Add sprite with Toon shader material
   - Add 2D light (Global Light 2D)
   - Verify basic toon shading appears

2. **Feature Tests**:
   - Test multiple shade colors and steps
   - Test rim light visibility
   - Test outlines (both normal and position-based)
   - Test with multiple 2D lights
   - Test shadow receiving
   - Test emissive (static and animated)

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Test with many sprites using GPU instancing
   - Test with multiple 2D lights
   - Profile frame time and draw calls
   - Verify batching efficiency

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with transparent sprites
   - Test with rotated/scaled sprites
   - Test with different camera distances
   - Test with 2D camera (orthographic)

## Integration Notes

### For Users
- No changes required to existing 3D materials
- 2D functionality is automatic when using 2D Renderer
- All existing shader parameters work in 2D mode
- Material inspector UI remains the same

### For Developers
- New shader files follow same coding conventions
- Uses standard URP includes and functions
- Compatible with Unity 2021.3+ and URP 10.5.0+
- Follows Unity's shader best practices

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for future versions:
1. MatCap support for 2D (view-space based)
2. Angel Ring for 2D characters
3. Sprite shape optimization
4. Tile map specific features
5. 2D shadow casting (for layered 2D)
6. Additional 2D-specific effects
7. Shader Graph version for easier customization

## Conclusion

The Unity Toon Shader package now fully supports the URP 2D Renderer with all major toon shading features. The implementation maintains compatibility with existing 3D functionality while providing optimized rendering for 2D projects. Users can now create cel-shaded 2D games with the same powerful toon shading tools previously available only for 3D.
