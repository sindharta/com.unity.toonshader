4. **Same inspector UI**: No changes to material editor

### For New Users
1. Read [2D Quick Start Guide](Documentation~/2D-Quick-Start.md)
2. Follow setup instructions
3. Create first toon material
4. Experiment with parameters

### For Existing Users
1. Update to latest package version
2. 2D support works automatically with 2D Renderer
3. Review [2D Renderer Support](Documentation~/2D-Renderer-Support.md) for 2D-specific features
4. No changes needed for existing 3D projects

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. MatCap not implemented for 2D (can be added in future)
2. Angel Ring not implemented for 2D (can be added in future)
3. Tessellation not available (by design, not applicable to 2D)
4. Scene view shows simplified lighting (Unity limitation)

### Performance Considerations
1. Multiple additional lights can impact performance
2. Outlines add extra draw calls (one per material)
3. Normal mapping adds texture sampling overhead
4. Disable unused features for best performance

### Workarounds
1. For MatCap: Use emissive maps as alternative
2. For Angel Ring: Use rim light as alternative
3. For performance: Disable unused shader features
4. For scene view: Test in Game view for accurate rendering

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. MatCap implementation for 2D
2. Angel Ring for 2D characters
3. Sprite shape optimization
4. Tile map specific features
5. 2D shadow casting support
6. Shader Graph version

### Community Requests
- Additional 2D-specific effects
- More performance optimizations
- Extended documentation
- Video tutorials
- Sample scenes
