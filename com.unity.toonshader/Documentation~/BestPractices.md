# Best Practices Guide

This guide provides professional tips and techniques for getting the most out of Unity Toon Shader in your projects.

## üé® Artistic Best Practices

### Color Design Principles

#### Three-Color System
- **Base Color**: Should be your character's most vibrant, appealing color
- **1st Shading**: Typically 60-70% brightness of base color, often with slight color shift
- **2nd Shading**: Usually 30-40% brightness, often with complementary color tint (e.g., blue/purple for warm base colors)

#### Color Harmony
- Use color theory principles for pleasing combinations
- Consider your scene's overall color palette
- Test colors in different lighting conditions
- Use color temperature shifts in shadows (cooler shadows for warm lights)

### Texture Creation

#### UV Mapping
- Ensure proper UV unwrapping for your models
- Avoid overlapping UVs unless intentional
- Use consistent texel density across your model
- Test UV layouts with checkerboard textures

#### Texture Resolution
- Use appropriate resolutions for your target platform
- Consider using different resolutions for different features (e.g., higher res for base maps, lower for control maps)
- Use texture atlasing for better performance

#### Shadow Control Maps
- Paint shadows where they would naturally occur
- Use soft gradients for smooth transitions
- Consider the character's anatomy and form
- Test with different lighting angles

## üîß Technical Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

#### Mobile Optimization
```
Recommended Settings for Mobile:
- Use URP render pipeline
- Limit texture resolution to 1024x1024 or lower
- Use fewer active shader features
- Consider using simpler outline methods
- Test on actual target devices
```

#### Console/Desktop Optimization
```
Recommended Settings for Console/Desktop:
- Use HDRP for maximum visual quality
- Take advantage of tessellation features
- Use higher resolution textures
- Enable all desired features
- Optimize for your target hardware
```

### Material Organization

#### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names: `Character_Hair_UTS`, `Environment_Rock_UTS`
- Include render pipeline in name if using multiple: `Character_UTS_URP`
- Version your materials: `Character_v1`, `Character_v2`

#### Material Variants
- Create material variants for different lighting conditions
- Use variants for different quality settings
- Organize variants in folders by character/object type

### Scene Setup

#### Lighting Setup
- Use consistent lighting across your project
- Consider using multiple light setups for different scenes
- Test materials under various lighting conditions
- Use light probes for dynamic objects

#### Camera Setup
- Set up cameras with appropriate field of view
- Consider using multiple cameras for different purposes
- Test outline visibility at different distances
- Use post-processing effects appropriately

## üéØ Workflow Best Practices

### Development Pipeline

#### Pre-Production
1. **Define Art Style**: Establish color palettes and shading styles
2. **Create Style Guide**: Document your approach for team consistency
3. **Set Up Templates**: Create material templates for common elements
4. **Test Pipeline**: Verify your workflow with sample assets

#### Production
1. **Iterate Quickly**: Use real-time preview to experiment
2. **Maintain Consistency**: Use templates and style guides
3. **Version Control**: Keep track of material changes
4. **Regular Testing**: Test on target platforms regularly

#### Post-Production
1. **Final Polish**: Fine-tune materials for final output
2. **Performance Review**: Optimize for target platforms
3. **Documentation**: Update style guides and templates
4. **Archive**: Save final materials and settings

### Team Collaboration

#### Asset Sharing
- Use consistent naming conventions across the team
- Share material templates and style guides
- Document custom shader modifications
- Use version control for material assets

#### Quality Control
- Establish review processes for materials
- Test assets across different platforms
- Maintain style consistency across artists
- Regular team training on new features

- Use efficient rendering techniques
- Consider using simpler shader variants
- Test on actual VR hardware

#### Visual Considerations
- Consider viewing distance and scale
- Use appropriate contrast for VR displays
- Test comfort levels for extended use
- Consider motion sickness factors

## üé® Style-Specific Techniques

### Anime/Manga Style

#### Character Shading
- Use clear, defined shadow boundaries
